    <br>
    <p> My favourite thing to do is ride my bike, it was invented my a man named Karl von Drais, he also invented the typewriter. Biking can give you a full on Cardio workout as well. Bikes are also easy to ride, so they do not need licences... well for foot powered, motor biking however does need a licence, but I am not even old enough to try for one, butr i will definetly get on when I am older. Bikes are alos easier to care of and cheaper, you just need to buy it once and take it to service every half year.And That is why I love biking.
